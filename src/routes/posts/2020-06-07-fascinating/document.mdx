That gif is from an episode called: The Corbomite Maneuver. It was one of the earliest episodes where the Spock character had not yet been established. The Enterprise had encountered a ship of tremendous size. There were various reaction fear shots of the characters. The director was conflicted because Spock would show no emotion. Leonard Nimoy simply said, Mr. Spock is a scientist. He would respond with a scientific reaction.....thus fascinating was used for the very first time with Mr. Spock
